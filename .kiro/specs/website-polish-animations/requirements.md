# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on adding modern "wow factor" polish to the Mulsower SV 61 website through carefully crafted CSS animations, micro-interactions, and visual enhancements. The goal is to create a more engaging and modern user experience while maintaining the site's performance and static nature. All enhancements will use pure CSS/Tailwind and modern web standards to ensure compatibility with the existing static export setup.

## Non-Goals

- No external script CDNs or tracking libraries
- No heavy parallax physics or WebGL effects
- No third-party animation libraries
- No cross-page transitions (static export limitation)
- No fake loading spinners for external links

## Browser Support

- Last 2 versions of Chromium, Firefox, and Safari
- iOS ≥ 16, Android ≥ 10
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Motion System Standards

- **Durations:** 120-220ms for micro-interactions, 150-200ms for hover effects
- **Easing:** Default `cubic-bezier(0.2,0,0,1)` (standard), `cubic-bezier(0.3,0,0,1)` (emphasis)
- **Properties:** Animate only `opacity` and `transform` for optimal performance
- **Constraint:** Maximum one animation effect per component at a time

## Performance Budgets

- Animation JavaScript ≤ 5 KB gzipped
- Total JavaScript ≤ 50 KB gzipped
- LCP images ≤ 120 KB (AVIF/WebP preferred)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1
- Lighthouse Mobile Performance ≥ 90 (Fast 3G + 4× CPU throttle)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want smooth and engaging hover effects on interactive elements, so that the website feels modern and responsive to my interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over buttons/navigation/sponsor cards THEN the system SHALL display 150-200ms transitions using only `transform` and `opacity` properties
2. WHEN hover effects trigger THEN the system SHALL use two fixed shadow tiers (`shadow-sm` base, `shadow-md` hover) without animating blur/spread
3. WHEN a user hovers over the logo THEN the system SHALL apply subtle effects (rotate ≤ 3° or scale ≤ 1.03)
4. WHEN on desktop devices THEN the system SHALL use `@media (hover:hover) and (pointer:fine)` for hover styles
5. WHEN on touch devices THEN the system SHALL use `@media (hover:none) and (pointer:coarse)` for touch feedback with `:active` states

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want content to smoothly appear as I scroll through the page, so that the browsing experience feels dynamic and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content enters viewport THEN the system SHALL use Intersection Observer API with 0.15 threshold for reveal animations
2. WHEN multiple items animate THEN the system SHALL stagger timing by 60ms between items with total group delay ≤ 400ms
3. WHEN large sections load THEN the system SHALL apply `content-visibility: auto` and `contain-intrinsic-size: 1px 800px` for performance
4. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN the system SHALL ensure content remains visible (no "invisible until JS" flash)
5. WHEN `prefers-reduced-motion` is set THEN the system SHALL disable all scroll-triggered animations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want smooth page transitions and loading states, so that navigation feels seamless and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN internal navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL use `scroll-behavior: smooth` only when not `prefers-reduced-motion`
2. WHEN pages load THEN the system SHALL implement global page fade (body opacity: 0 → 1) within 180ms via `requestAnimationFrame`
3. WHEN external links are clicked THEN the system SHALL display external link icon with tooltip "Opens external site" and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
4. WHEN users navigate THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling without loading spinners for external resources
5. WHEN page transitions occur THEN the system SHALL avoid cross-page transitions due to static export limitations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want enhanced visual polish through modern CSS effects, so that the website appears professional and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing cards/containers THEN the system SHALL use fixed shadow tiers (base `shadow-sm`, hover `shadow-md`) without animating blur/spread
2. WHEN viewing buttons THEN the system SHALL allow subtle linear/conic gradients without infinite shimmer loops
3. WHEN backdrop blur is used THEN the system SHALL apply only to overlays with solid background fallback via `@supports not (backdrop-filter: blur(1px))`
4. WHEN focus states activate THEN the system SHALL provide modern focus indicators with smooth transitions
5. WHEN scrolling occurs THEN the system SHALL prevent long tasks > 50ms during scroll/navigation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website visitor using a mobile device, I want touch-optimized animations and interactions, so that the mobile experience is as polished as the desktop version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN touch interactions occur THEN the system SHALL use short `:active` scale/opacity effects instead of complex ripple animations
2. WHEN mobile animations run THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps by limiting to one transform animation at a time
3. WHEN on touch devices THEN the system SHALL increase timing by 20% (e.g., 200ms → 240ms) for better touch feedback
4. WHEN `navigator.connection?.saveData === true` OR `navigator.deviceMemory <= 4` THEN the system SHALL reduce animation effects
5. WHEN mobile performance is constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade animation complexity

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website administrator, I want all animations to maintain the site's performance standards, so that the enhanced experience doesn't compromise loading speed or accessibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN animations are implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain Lighthouse Mobile Performance ≥ 90 under Fast 3G + 4× CPU throttle
2. WHEN `prefers-reduced-motion` is detected THEN the system SHALL disable all animations and use `scroll-behavior: auto`
3. WHEN animations execute THEN the system SHALL use hardware acceleration (transform, opacity only) and avoid animating layout properties
4. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL maintain static export compatibility with no dynamic imports of third-party libraries
5. WHEN motion needs to be disabled THEN the system SHALL support `<html data-motion="reduced">` override to force-disable all motion

## Accessibility & Compliance Requirements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the website to remain fully accessible with animations, so that I can navigate and interact without barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN animations are active THEN the system SHALL ensure no information is conveyed by animation alone (active nav uses underline + color)
2. WHEN focus states are animated THEN the system SHALL maintain AA contrast ratios for all interactive/hover/focus states
3. WHEN reduced motion is preferred THEN the system SHALL provide `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` fallbacks with `transition: none`
4. WHEN keyboard navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL ensure all animated elements remain keyboard accessible
5. WHEN accessibility tools scan THEN the system SHALL introduce no new violations in automated accessibility tests

## Technical Implementation Standards

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reusable animation utilities and tokens, so that animations are consistent and maintainable across the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing animations THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind custom timing tokens (`fast: 150ms`, `base: 180ms`, `slow: 220ms`)
2. WHEN creating easing functions THEN the system SHALL use `standard: cubic-bezier(0.2,0,0,1)` and `emph: cubic-bezier(0.3,0,0,1)`
3. WHEN implementing scroll reveals THEN the system SHALL use a reusable `.reveal` utility class with reduced motion fallbacks
4. WHEN adding animations THEN the system SHALL limit dependencies to small internal utilities only (ESM, ≤5 KB)
5. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL ensure all animation code is static-export safe without runtime dependencies

## Quality Assurance Requirements

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want clear testing criteria for animations, so that I can verify the implementation meets all standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing manually THEN the system SHALL be verified on iOS Safari and Android Chrome with keyboard-only navigation
2. WHEN testing accessibility THEN the system SHALL pass axe-core scans with no new violations from animated/focus states
3. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL maintain CLS < 0.1 and prevent font/image layout shifts using `aspect-ratio` and `font-display: swap`
4. WHEN testing reduced motion THEN the system SHALL verify all animations are disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
5. WHEN testing static export THEN the system SHALL verify 404/robots/sitemap remain present and correct after animation implementation
