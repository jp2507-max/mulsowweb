## Appendix: Optional Rive Animated Logo (Task 3)

- Feature is implemented behind a flag and disabled by default to preserve minimal bundle.
- Enable by setting `siteConfig.features.animatedLogo = true` in `app/config/site.ts`.
- Place your logo asset at `public/rive/logo.riv` or adjust `siteConfig.features.riveLogoSrc`.
- Behavior:
	- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` and falls back to static `/logo.svg`.
	- Pauses when offscreen and when the page is hidden.
	- Announces play/pause via an `aria-live="polite"` message for assistive tech.
